		<h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

		<h2>Headings</h2>
		<p>Headings define the outline of you site. There are six levels of
			headings.</p>

		<h2>Lists</h2>
		<h3>This is how you make an unordered list:</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
			<li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
			<li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Wrong example of using a list</h3>
		<!-- (this is bad!) -->
		<ul>
			<p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p>
		</ul>

		<h3>Good example of using a list</h3>
		<!-- (Do this instead) -->
		<ul>
			<li><p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How do we know that "ul" elements only accpets "li" elements <br> and that
			"li" elements allows nested paragraphs?</h3>
			<p>Because the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) says so. whenever you're
				not sure <br> about a particular element, do a quick Google search for
				"MDN 'some-element'".</p>

		<h3>This is what an ordered list looks like</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
			<li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
			<li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
			<li>You should be noticing things in this precies order, because this is
				an ordered list</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Inline Elements</h2>
		<p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
			phrase.</p>
		<p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
			of a word or phrase</p>
		<p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

		<h2>Empty Elements</h2>
		<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
		<p>Regards, <br>

		<p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS
			soon.</p>
